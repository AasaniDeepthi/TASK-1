Task 1: Open Ports Scan     

Step 1: Installed Nmap from the official website.
Step 2: After that I find my IP address using command prompt with ipconfig command.
 
Step3: Then after I got 192.168.201.109 IP address. Using Nmap command 
              nmap -ss 192.168.201.109/24 performed TCP SYN scan.
 
Step 4: I did packet capture analyze with Wireshark , But I did find any common services running on those ports.
 
Potential security risks from open ports:
When we open a network port, you are essentially creating a doorway into your network. This doorway can be exploited by malicious actors who are looking for vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to our systems.

Unauthorized Access: Open ports can serve as an entry point for hackers to infiltrate your network and gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or resources.

Malware Infections: By leaving ports open, you increase the likelihood of malware finding its way into your network, potentially causing data breaches or system disruptions.

Denial of Service Attacks: Open ports can also be used as a target for denial of service (DoS) attacks, where an attacker overwhelms your network with traffic, rendering it unavailable to legitimate users.

Data Exfiltration: If a malicious actor gains access to your network through an open port, they can easily exfiltrate sensitive data without your knowledge.
Compromised Devices: Open ports can allow attackers to compromise individual devices on your network, turning them into bots for further attacks or using them as a launching pad for attacks on other networks.
